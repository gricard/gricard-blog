Check che-check-check checka-check it out!

Sorry, I'm in a Beastie Boys mood lately, thanks to getting [this amazing book](https://smile.amazon.com/Beastie-Boys-Book-Michael-Diamond/dp/0812995546). Go read it. It's soooo good.

Anyway, I just need a place to put some thoughts. Mostly lately I've been focused on running and fitness, hence
the .run domain I snagged for this. (Remember when it was just .com/.net/.org/.edu?)

More to come!
