I've added a special page to this site now to keep track of articles about running gear I use. I'm just as nerdy about running gear as I am about computers and anything else. Sure, you can just get some shoes and go run, but there's a *lot* of useful items out there that can improve the experience and help you out. 

I'll be adding pages to this section over time, highlighting the products I use.

Here is the [new gear page](/gear).
